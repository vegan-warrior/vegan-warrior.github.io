If you want to maintain and improve your health after eliminating animal products, rather than ending up with hormonal imbalances and hair loss in six months, this guide is for you.


### Step 1: Focus on Protein and Fats

Plant-based food is carbohydrate-heavy, so it’s crucial to avoid falling into a carb trap. Protein and fats, especially during the initial phase, need to be **carefully monitored**.

Protein requirement: 1g per kg of body weight. For instance, if you weigh 60 kg, you should consume at least 60g of protein daily. Best sources: legumes and whole grains. Can’t hit your protein target with food alone? Incorporate protein supplements.

Fat intake should also be calculated at ~1g per kg of body weight. Minimize oils, even unrefined ones, and replace them with whole fat sources like nuts, seeds, and avocados. These not only provide fats but also protein, fiber, and various vitamins and minerals.

Track protein and fat content in your food using apps like Cronometer or FatSecret.

Once you’ve met your protein and fat needs, you can add fruits, dried fruits, and other carbohydrates. This step is listed first for a reason—how responsibly you approach protein and fats in your diet will affect not just your health but also your eating behavior. Insufficient protein and fats lead to cravings and episodes of intense hunger.


### Step 2: Iron and Calcium

These two nutrients are the first to become deficient without proper planning. Include legumes, black sesame, chia seeds, fortified plant-based milk, and dark leafy greens in your daily diet.

Remember, iron and calcium are affected by phytic acid, a compound present in all grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Phytic acid binds minerals, reducing their bioavailability. To maximize benefits, soak these foods in plain water overnight. This activates the enzyme phytase, which breaks down phytic acid and enhances nutrient absorption.

Avoid drinking coffee after meals rich in iron—caffeine also inhibits iron absorption from plant sources. No need to give it up entirely, but wait 2–3 hours before having coffee.

Daily calcium requirement: 1,000 mg. Iron: 18 mg for women and 8 mg for men.


### Step 3: Include Supplements

Bad news: you can’t maintain a vegan diet without supplements. This is because plant-based foods lack vitamins B12 and D, which are only found in animal products like meat and fatty fish.

Good news: proper use of supplements in a plant-based diet is not only safe but also officially recommended.

The bare minimum includes the aforementioned vitamins B12 and D, which are essential for anyone not consuming animal products. Before starting any supplements, get your blood tested to assess your body’s levels of each nutrient. Without this, it’s impossible to determine an appropriate dosage or track progress.

Remember, 99% of dietary supplements lack proven efficacy, are not safe, and are not recommended by any health organization worldwide. This includes spirulina, Peruvian maca, sunflower lecithin, and other heavily marketed supplements endorsed by lifestyle bloggers.
